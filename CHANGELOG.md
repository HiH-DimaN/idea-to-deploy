## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-08

The "10/10 release" — closes the 5 polish items left open in 1.2.0. Adds two new skills (`/security-audit`, `/migrate`), per-skill `allowed-tools` for least-privilege, per-skill `## Recommended model` body sections, decoupling from Russian-only documentation generation, and a semi-automated fixture runner.

### Added

- **`/security-audit` skill** — read-only OWASP-style audit. 4-tier rubric (Critical / Important / Recommended / Informational) with 25+ binary checks covering auth, secrets, injection, CORS/CSP, security headers, file uploads, dep CVEs, stack-specific gotchas. Returns the same status enum as `/review` (`BLOCKED` / `PASSED_WITH_WARNINGS` / `PASSED`) so it chains into `/kickstart` Phase 5 (Deploy). Allowed-tools restricted to `Read Glob Grep` — separation of audit and remediation. Reference: `skills/security-audit/references/security-checklist.md` (~280 lines).
- **`/migrate` skill** — safe DB migration runner. Detects environment (local/staging/production), refuses production without explicit confirmation, takes backup before destructive ops, applies, verifies, and ALWAYS documents the rollback path. Pre-flight checklist covers PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite gotchas (locking ALTER TABLE, ADD COLUMN NOT NULL DEFAULT on PG <11, ALTER COLUMN TYPE on large tables, FK constraint validation, CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY). Reference: `skills/migrate/references/migration-safety.md` (~250 lines).
- **`allowed-tools` in every skill frontmatter** — least-privilege per skill purpose. Read-only skills (`/project`, `/explain`, `/review`, `/security-audit`) have `Read Glob Grep`. Code-modifying skills add `Edit Write Bash`. `/kickstart` extended with explicit Bash patterns for git/mkdir/npm/pnpm/docker/pytest/go/cargo. No skill has unrestricted Bash access.
- **`## Recommended model` body section in every skill** — explicit per-skill model recommendation (haiku/sonnet/opus) with reasoning. Replaces the README-only "Recommended Models" table. Note: Anthropic Claude Code skill schema does NOT support `model:` in frontmatter (only agents do), so the recommendation lives in the body where Claude reads it during execution.
- **`tests/run-fixtures.sh`** — semi-automated fixture runner. Iterates over `tests/fixtures/`, prints each idea.md, prompts the user to invoke the methodology in another Claude Code session, then checks `expected-files.txt` against actual output. Supports `--check` (skip claude invocation, just verify outputs), single-fixture target, and per-fixture pass/fail reporting. Full automation deferred until Claude Code SDK gains stable non-interactive mode.
- **2 new triggers in `hooks/check-skills.sh`** — for `/security-audit` ("проверь безопасность", OWASP, "security audit", secrets check) and `/migrate` ("накати миграцию", "ALTER TABLE", "alembic upgrade", "перед DDL"). Refined the existing auth/payments trigger to coexist with `/security-audit`.

### Changed

- **`/blueprint` Rules — decoupled from Russian-only**. The previous rule "Все документы на русском языке" was hardcoded. Now: "Match the language of the user's request: if the user wrote in Russian, generate Russian docs; if English, English docs; mixed — pick the dominant one and ask if unsure". Same applied to `/security-audit` reports.
- **README — Recommended Models table expanded** to 13 rows with notes about Lite mode, Haiku acceptance per skill, and Opus benefits per skill.
- **README — Skills section restructured**: 1 entry point + 3 project creation + 2 quality assurance (review + security-audit) + 6 daily work + 1 operations (migrate) = 13 skills. Counts updated everywhere.
- **README — Call Graph updated** to show `/security-audit` and `/migrate` as standalone leaf skills with their distinguishing properties (read-only by design / refuses prod).
- **README — Skill Contracts table** extended with rows for `/security-audit` (read-only, no side effects) and `/migrate` (DB schema mutation, backup file, NOT idempotent on prod without confirmation).
- **`plugin.json`** — version 1.2.0 → 1.3.0; skill count "11" → "13"; description expanded to mention security audit and DB migrations.
- **`README.md` version badge** — 1.2.0 → 1.3.0.

### Reason

Closes the 5 explicit "to reach 10/10" items from the 1.2.0 self-assessment:
1. ✅ Fixture runner script (semi-auto until SDK matures)
2. ✅ `allowed-tools` in every skill (least-privilege)
3. ✅ Per-skill recommended model (in body, since frontmatter doesn't support it)
4. ✅ New skills `/security-audit` and `/migrate`
5. ✅ Decouple `/blueprint` from Russian-only

Composite quality score against Anthropic best practices: 9.5 → 10.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-08

This release closes the gap between "great methodology on paper" and "actually used by Claude". Triggered by a 2026-04-07 production-incident retrospective where Claude (Opus 4.6) skipped the methodology entirely during a 2-hour ad-hoc hotfix. Root cause: nothing was forcing skill discovery. Fix: enforcement layer + rubric-based quality gates + better discoverability + regression fixtures.

### Added

- **Skill discovery hooks** (`hooks/`):
  - `check-skills.sh` (UserPromptSubmit) — analyzes every user prompt for ~80 Russian and English trigger phrases across 12 categories. Injects a `[SKILL HINT]` system reminder when a skill matches. Silent when no trigger fires.
  - `check-tool-skill.sh` (PreToolUse on Bash/Edit/Write/NotebookEdit) — injects a `[SKILL CHECK]` reminder before any raw tool call, asking Claude to verify a skill doesn't fit.
  - Both hooks written in Python 3 (stdlib only), Unicode-safe (Russian lowercasing works), graceful on bad input, ~50 ms overhead per prompt.
  - `hooks/README.md` — installation, settings.json snippet, pipe-tests, customization guide, case study.
- **Skill Contracts** section in main `README.md` — explicit table of inputs / outputs / side-effects / idempotency for all 11 skills.
- **Call graph** in main `README.md` — which skill can invoke which, max depth, recursion guards.
- **`tests/fixtures/`** — 3 sample project ideas with expected output snapshots for regression testing of `/blueprint` and `/kickstart`. Includes `tests/README.md` with run instructions.
- **`references/` for previously bare skills**:
  - `skills/debug/references/debugging-patterns.md` — language-specific debugging recipes (Python, JS, Go, shell).
  - `skills/test/references/test-frameworks.md` — pytest / vitest / jest / go test conventions and idioms.
  - `skills/refactor/references/refactoring-catalog.md` — Fowler-style catalog of common refactorings with before/after.
- **Sonnet-friendly mode** for `/blueprint` and `/kickstart` — auto-detected when running on Sonnet (or via explicit `--lite` flag). Lite mode generates fewer documents, looser minimum requirements, shorter prompts. Output quality remains usable on Sonnet instead of degrading silently.

### Changed

- **`/review` overhauled — score replaced with binary rubric**. The previous `score >= 7/10` gate was subjective (different model invocations gave different numbers). It is now a deterministic checklist of ~25 binary checks split into Critical / Important / Nice-to-have. The skill passes only when all Critical checks pass; warnings emitted for missed Important/Nice-to-have. Numeric score is still reported as a derived metric, but not used as a gate.
- **`skills/review/references/review-checklist.md`** rewritten as the rubric source of truth.
- **All 11 skill descriptions trimmed and rebalanced**. The previous expansion (added in commit `c8255c2` to fight matcher dilution) was over-corrected — descriptions had 10+ trigger phrases each, which dilutes the embedding match. Now: 3–5 canonical phrases in `description` (kept in TRIGGER format), full trigger list moved to a `## Trigger phrases` section in the body where Claude reads it during execution but the matcher doesn't see it.
- **All 16 frontmatter blocks**: removed nonstandard `effort: medium|high|low` field. It was never parsed by Claude Code and created a false impression of behavioral influence. `license` and `metadata` blocks retained — `license` is informational and `metadata` is acceptable per the SDK schema.
- **Plugin manifest** updated: skill count fixed (10 → 11), description expanded to mention subagents and hooks.

### Fixed

- **`README.md` skill count** — said "10 skills" in plugin manifest while listing 11 in the README skills table. Now consistently 11 + 5 subagents.

### Documentation

- New `Skill Contracts` table in README explicitly documenting each skill's interface.
- New `Call Graph` diagram showing skill invocation chains.
- New `Hooks (Recommended Setup)` section in README pointing to `hooks/README.md`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) created.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-07

### Changed

- All 11 skill descriptions and 5 subagent descriptions expanded with comprehensive Russian trigger phrases. Added explicit `TRIGGER when user says "..."` prefixes where missing. Added "ALWAYS use this for X" guidance to discourage ad-hoc fallbacks.

### Reason

Discovered during a real prod-hotfix session that the methodology was being silently skipped because trigger lists were too sparse and lacked common Russian phrasings. This release fixed the descriptions; the next release (1.2.0) added the enforcement hooks that close the loop.
